MOS-X python package. Tools for building, running, and validating a machine learning model for predicting tomorrow's
weather. 'MOS-X' represents an intelligent improvement to the tradition Model Output Statistics of the National
Weather Service and other meteorological institutions.

2018-04-10: Version 0.9.0
    -- better implementation of base estimator attributes in TimeSeriesEstimator and RainTuningEstimator classes
    -- added submodule 'predict' for unified predictions
    -- improved handling of the raw precipitation values to allow them to be used in rain tuning
    -- added config option for the starting hour of a forecast day
    -- added config option to predict probability of precipitation rather than quantity
    -- added automatic fetching of CF6 files
    -- added automatic retrieval of climo_station_id (removed from default.config)
